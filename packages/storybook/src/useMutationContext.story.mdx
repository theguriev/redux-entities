    mutationKey = 'global',
    onStart = () => {},
    onSuccess = () => {},

} = useMutationContext(somethingToMergeWithReturns)
```

## Options
* `somethingToMergeWithReturns: Object` - any Record<string, unknow> which will be merged with options what was passed through MutationContext. We use it inside the useMutation hook so I have no idea why you might need it but anyway here is some info about it. U can set this global options like this:
```js
import { MutationContext } from '@redux-things/core'

<MutationContext.Provider value={{ mutationKey: 'mutation' }}>
    <App />
</MutationContext.Provider>
```

## Returns

* `mutationKey: string` - thing mutation key. Can be any string and usually we use something like MSomething, MWhatever, etc.
* `onStart: Function` - will be fired when mutate will be launched.
* `onSuccess: Function` - when promise will resolved.
* `onError: Function` - when promise will rejected.
