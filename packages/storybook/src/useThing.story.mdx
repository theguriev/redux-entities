```

## Options
* `thingKey: string` - thing key. Can be any string but usually we use something like TSomething, TWhatever, etc.
* `fetchFn: Function` - any promise which will return your data.
* `hookOptions: Object` - hook options.

### Hook options

* `reducer: Function` - classical redux reducer.
* `selector: Function` - selector to select data from the store.
* `initialData: Function | any` - if set, this value will be used as the initial data for the thing.
* `getFetchMore = () => boolean | object` function to generate fetch options to fetchMore function.
    * When new data is received for this thing, this function receives last options, last fetch result of the infinite list of data and the full array of all chunks.
    * Return `false` to indicate there is no next page available.
* `dataMapper: Function` - data mapper function. It will prepare your data before showing it somewhere. Use *mappedData* as a result of dataMapper.
* `skip: boolean`
    * Set this to **true** to disable this thing from automatically running.
    * Can be used for dependent entities.
* `cache: string`
    * 'no-cache' - try to fetch on the first usage of the hook.
    * 'cache-first' - get data from the cache and if there is not cache fetch it.
* `options: Record<string, unknown>` - will be passed into fetch, fetchMore, refetch  function and selector as a second argument. Here should be only data which can be serialized.
* `refetchOnWindowFocus: boolean` - If set to true, the thing will refetch on window focus if the data is stale.
* `refetchInterval: false | number` - If set to a number, all things will continuously refetch at this frequency in milliseconds.
* `reFetchIntervalInBackground: boolean` - If set to true, things that are set to continuously refetch with a refetchInterval will continue to refetch while their tab/window is in the background.
* `onStart: Function` - will be fired when fetching will be launched.
* `onSuccess: Function` - when promise will resolved.
* `onError: Function` - when promise will rejected.
* `namespace: string` - global actions namespace. Default: `@redux-things`
* `delimiter: string` - type delimiter. Using for separate type, key and namespace. Eample: @redux-things/TSomething/Fullfiled. Default: `/`
* `debounceInterval: number` - changing options trigger debounce interval.
namespace,
        delimiter,
        debounceInterval,
* `...extra: any` - anything you wanna pass to fetchFn.  Usually, it's some API client or something like that.

## Returns

* `isError: boolean` - has some errors or not.
* `isLoading: boolean` - true if the thing is currently fetching.
* `isRefetching: boolean` - true if the thing is currently refetching.
* `isInitial: boolean` - true if the data is in initial state.
* `error: any` - the error object or string.
* `data`
    * Defaults to `null`.
    * The last successfully resolved data for the thing.
* `mappedData: Record<string, unknown>` - prepared ( by dataMapper option ) data.
* `refetch: Function` - a function to manually refetch the thing.
* `fetchMore: Function` - a function to manually fetchMore the thing with additional request options. Example:
```js
fetchMore({ offset: 10, limit: 10 }).then(res => console.log)
// or
fetchMore()
```
* `preFetch: Function` - a function to manually prefetch the thing.
* `canFetchMore: boolean` - the result of getFetchMore function.
* `toType: Function` - a function to generate type based on string. Example: toType('something') === `${namespace}/${key}/something`
* `actions`
    * `pending: Function` - pending action creator function.
    * `fulfilled: Function` - fulfilled action creator function.
    * `error: Function` - error action creator function.
