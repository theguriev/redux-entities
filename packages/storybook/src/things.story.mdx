# Things

A thing is a declarative dependency on an asynchronous source of data that is tied to a **unique key**. A thing can be used with any Promise based method (including GET and POST methods) to fetch data from a server. If your method modifies data on the server, we recommend using [Mutations](/story/concepts-mutations--page) instead.

To subscribe to a thing in your components or custom hooks, call the `useThing` hook with at least:

- A **unique key for the thing**
- A function that returns a promise that:
    - Resolves the data, or
    - Throws an error

```js
import { useThing } from '@redux-things/core'

const App = () => {
    const whatever = useThing('posts', fetchPosts)
}
```

The **unique key** you provide is used internally for refetching, caching, and sharing your things throughout your redux store.

The thing results returned by `useThing` contains all of the information about the thing that you'll need for templating and any other usage of the data:

```js
const result = useThing('posts', fetchPosts)
```

The `result` object contains a few very important states you'll need to be aware of to be productive:

- `isLoading` - The thing has no data and is currently fetching
- `isError` - The thing encountered an error
- `isInitial` - The data has not yet loaded. Starting state.

Beyond those primary states, more information is available depending on the state of the thing:

- `error` - If the thing is in an `isError` state, the error is available via the `error` property.
- `data` - If the thing is in a success state, the data is available via the `data` property.

For **most** things, it's usually sufficient to check for the `isLoading` state, then the `isError` state, then finally, assume that the data is available and render the successful state:

```js
const Posts = () => {
    const { isLoading, isError, data, error } = useThing('posts', fetchPosts)
    if (isLoading) {
        return <span>Loading...</span>
    }
    if (isError) {
        return <span>Error: {error}</span>
    }

    return (
        <ul>
            {data.map(post => (<li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>))}
        </ul>
    )
}
```
