# useThingContext


```js
const {
    reducer,
    selector,
    initialData,
    getFetchMore,
    dataMapper,
    onStart,
    onSuccess,
    onError,
    skip,
    cache,
    options: externalOptions,
    reFetchOnWindowFocus,
    reFetchInterval,
    reFetchIntervalInBackground,
    ...extra
} = useThingsContext(somethingToMergeWithReturns)
```

## Options
* `somethingToMergeWithReturns: Object` - any Record<string, unknow> which will be merged with options what was passed through ThingsContext. We use it inside the useThing hook so I have no idea why you might need it but anyway here is some info about it. U can set this global options like this:
```js
import { ThingsContext } from '@redux-things/core'

<ThingsContext.Provider value={{
    apiClient: () => console.log('U can reach this in fetchFn'),
    skip: true // all useThing will be skipped by default
}}>
    <App />
</ThingsContext.Provider>
```

## Returns

* `reducer: Function` - classical redux reducer.
* `selector: Function` - selector to select data from the store.
* `initialData: Function | any` - if set, this value will be used as the initial data for the thing.
* `getFetchMore = () => boolean | object` function to generate fetch options to fetchMore function.
    * When new data is received for this thing, this function receives last options, last fetch result of the infinite list of data and the full array of all chunks.
    * Return `false` to indicate there is no next page available.
* `dataMapper: Function` - data mapper function. It will prepare your data before showing it somewhere. Use *mappedData* as a result of dataMapper.
* `skip: boolean`
    * Set this to **true** to disable this thing from automatically running.
    * Can be used for dependent entities.
* `cache: string`
    * 'no-cache' - try to fetch on the first usage of the hook.
    * 'cache-first' - get data from the cache and if there is not cache fetch it.
* `options: Record<string, unknown>` - will be passed into fetch, fetchMore, refetch  function and selector as a second argument. Here should be only data which can be serialized.
* `refetchOnWindowFocus: boolean` - If set to true, the thing will refetch on window focus if the data is stale.
* `refetchInterval: false | number` - If set to a number, all things will continuously refetch at this frequency in milliseconds.
* `reFetchIntervalInBackground: boolean` - If set to true, things that are set to continuously refetch with a refetchInterval will continue to refetch while their tab/window is in the background.
* `...extra: any` - anything you wanna pass to fetchFn.  Usually, it's some API client or something like that.
